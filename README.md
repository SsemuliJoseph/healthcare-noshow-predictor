# 🏥 AI Patient No-Show Predictor

### 🚀 The Problem
Medical clinics lose billions annually due to missed appointments. This project uses **Machine Learning** to identify "High-Risk" patients based on their history and demographics, allowing clinics to take proactive action.

### 🧠 The Solution
This is an end-to-end Scikit-Learn pipeline that handles:
- **Numerical Scaling**: Normalizing age and distance data.
- **Natural Language Processing (NLP)**: Using TF-IDF to analyze clinical health notes.
- **Classification**: A Random Forest model optimized for **Recall** (to minimize missed high-risk cases).

### 🛠️ Tech Stack
- **Python** & **Scikit-Learn** (Modeling)
- **Streamlit** (Web Interface)
- **Joblib** (Model Serialization)

### 📈 How to Run
1. Install requirements: `pip install -r requirements.txt`
2. Run the app: `streamlit run app.py`
